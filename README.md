  helm install my-release graphaware/hume
```

## Introduction

GraphAware charts for Helm are carefully engineered, actively maintained and are the quickest and easiest way to deploy containers on a Kubernetes cluster that are ready to handle production workloads.

This chart bootstraps a [Hume](https://github.com/XXX) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm repo add --username <username> --password <password> graphaware https://docker.graphaware.com/chartrepo/public
$ helm install my-release graphaware/hume
```

These commands deploy a Hume application on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`
## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm uninstall my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Ingress



## Parameters

### Global parameters

| Name                      | Description                                     | Value |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `global.imageRegistry`    | Global Docker image registry                    | `""`  |
| `global.imagePullSecrets` | Global Docker registry secret names as an array | `[]`  |
| `global.storageClass`     | Global StorageClass for Persistent Volume(s)    | `""`  |


### Common parameters

| Name                     | Description                                                                             | Value           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `kubeVersion`            | Force target Kubernetes version (using Helm capabilities if not set)                    | `""`            |
|

The above command sets the Keycloak administrator password to `secretpassword`.

> NOTE: Once this chart is deployed, it is not possible to change the application's access credentials, such as usernames or passwords, using Helm. To change these application credentials after deployment, delete any persistent volumes (PVs) used by the chart and re-deploy it, or use the application's built-in administrative tools if available.
Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install my-release -f values.yaml graphaware/hume
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)
Keycloak realms, users and clients can be created from the Keycloak administration panel. Refer to the [tutorial on adding user authentication to applications with Keycloak](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/integrate-keycloak-authentication-kubernetes) for more details on these operations.

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling vs Immutable tags](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Use an external database

Sometimes, you may want to have Keycloak connect to an external PostgreSQL database rather than a database within your cluster - for example, when using a managed database service, or when running a single database server for all your applications. To do this, set the `postgresql.enabled` parameter to `false` and specify the credentials for the external database using the `externalDatabase.*` parameters.

Refer to the [chart documentation on using an external database](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/apps/keycloak/configuration/use-external-database) for more details and an example.

> NOTE: Only PostgreSQL database server is supported as external database
### Add extra environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: KEYCLOAK_LOG_LEVEL
    value: DEBUG
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values.

### Use Sidecars and Init Containers

If additional containers are needed in the same pod (such as additional metrics or logging exporters), they can be defined using the `sidecars` config parameter. Similarly, extra init containers can be added using the `initContainers` parameter.

Refer to the chart documentation for more information on, and examples of, configuring and using [sidecars and init containers](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/apps/keycloak/configuration/configure-sidecar-init-containers/).

### Initialize a fresh instance

The [Bitnami Keycloak](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/keycloak) image allows you to use your custom scripts to initialize a fresh instance. In order to execute the scripts, you can specify custom scripts using the `initdbScripts` parameter as dict.

In addition to this option, you can also set an external ConfigMap with all the initialization scripts. This is done by setting the `initdbScriptsConfigMap` parameter. Note that this will override the previous option.

The allowed extensions is `.sh`.

### Deploy extra resources

There are cases where you may want to deploy extra objects, such a ConfigMap containing your app's configuration or some extra deployment with a micro service used by your app. For covering this case, the chart allows adding the full specification of other objects using the `extraDeploy` parameter.

### Set Pod affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `affinity` parameter. Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

### Configure Ingress

This chart provides support for Ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress-controller](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller) or [contour](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/contour) you can utilize the ingress controller to serve your application.

To enable Ingress integration, set `ingress.enabled` to `true`. The `ingress.hostname` property can be used to set the host name. The `ingress.tls` parameter can be used to add the TLS configuration for this host. It is also possible to have more than one host, with a separate TLS configuration for each host. [Learn more about configuring and using Ingress](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/apps/keycloak/configuration/configure-ingress/).

### Configure TLS Secrets for use with Ingress

The chart also facilitates the creation of TLS secrets for use with the Ingress controller, with different options for certificate management. [Learn more about TLS secrets](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/apps/keycloak/administration/enable-tls-ingress/).

### Use with ingress offloading SSL

If your ingress controller has the SSL Termination, you should set `proxy` to `edge`.

### Manage secrets and passwords

This chart provides several ways to manage passwords:

* Values passed to the chart
* An existing secret with all the passwords (via the `existingSecret` parameter)
* Multiple existing secrets with all the passwords (via the `existingSecretPerPassword` parameter)

Refer to the [chart documentation on managing passwords](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/apps/keycloak/configuration/manage-passwords/) for examples of each method.
