## Introduction

GraphAware charts for Helm are carefully engineered, actively maintained and are the quickest and easiest way to deploy containers on a Kubernetes cluster that are ready to handle production workloads.

This chart bootstraps a [Hume](https://github.com/graphaware/hume-helm-charts) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+
- Customer account in https://docker.graphaware.com/ in order to download both Helm chart and docker images

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

1, Create Docker secret in order to pull Docker images from private registry:
```bash
$ kubectl create namespace hume
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry graphaware-docker-creds --docker-server='docker.graphaware.com' --docker-username='<username>' --docker-password='<password>' --docker-email='<email>' -n helm
```
2, Add GraphAware Helm repository and install it:
```bash
$ helm repo add --username '<username>' --password '<password>' graphaware https://docker.graphaware.com/chartrepo/public

$ helm install my-release graphaware/hume --set baseDomain=<your-domain> -n hume
or
$ helm install my-release graphaware/hume -n hume -f values.yaml
```

These commands deploy a Hume application on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm uninstall my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
